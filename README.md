# Days-Of-Code-Practice
Coding exercises (katas). With given question prompts, methods are written and test methods created to check validity.

Coding practice for strings, conditional logic, loops, arrays, and collections in C#. All prompted questions are provided by John Fulton, instructor at Tech Elevator in Columbus, Ohio.

If given access, feel free to clear the code answers, and try for yourself. All test methods should check happy paths, error conditions, and edge cases (unless clearly defined that it won't in the question prompt).
